# LifeExpectancyPrediction_ML
This project involves utilizing Machine Learning Models to predict Life Expectancy in countries using various factors like alcohol consumption, health index, GDP and so on.
Some of the best predictors are Adult_Mortality, Alcohol Consumption, Percentage of GDP spent on health and average BMI of the country.
Overall, this project involves exploratory data analysis, correlation checks, and feature engineering such as Z-score normalization and one-hot encoding. A multiple linear regression model is built and evaluated using mean squared error on both training and test sets. Finally, K-fold cross-validation is employed to select the best combination of features with the lowest MSE.
